DogRaces
-----
A simple dog race betting simulation

This was my first project in Java, inspired by race simulation minigames such as in Harvest Moon and Fortune Street.

Mouse and keyboard input classes are modified from code found in Tim Wright's ![Java Games: Keyboard and Mouse tutorial](Java Games: Keyboard and Mouse tutorial).
